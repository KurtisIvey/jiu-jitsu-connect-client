<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

**Jiu Jitsu Connect** is a full stack project that leverages all the programming skills I have acquired so far to create a facebook clone. It features a React Frontend that is written in TypeScript using Vite. Redux is utilized to store session info on the client and persisted using redux-persist. Styling is done via the use of Tailwind CSS as the primary focus was functionality of the web app. The backend utilizes Javascript, AWS S3 bucket, MongoDB, Supertest, Node.js, and Express.js. Both the frontend and backend are hosted on heroku. AWS S3 bucket is utilized in the backend to handle image uploading from the frontend. Authentication is handled via the use of Json Web Tokens.

**Jiu Jitsu Connect client** is the frontend that communicates with my Odin-book-backend. It is a React frontend built using Vite due to Create-react-app no longer being supported. I wrote it in TypeScript to challenge and further develop my programming skills. Styling is done using Tailwind CSS as my primary focus was functionality of the web application. Redux is utilized to store session info as it is persisted using redux-persist. Demo access is available via the login page to tour the app.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

### Installation

This project is currently setup to only run in conjunction with the backend I created due to the various fetch calls located throughout the app. In order to use it, you would need to clone the repo from my backend, configure the proper env variables for it, and then replace the fetch urls with the url from the locally hosted backend.

## Usage

This front was primarily created to mimic many of the features present on Facebook such as registration, login, posting text, commenting text, updating usernames, updating profile photos, and adding/removing friends. It communicates with my Odin-book-backend. If you need a reference for such code examples, you're free to use/borrow/reference any of the code present. Reach out to me if you have any questions.
